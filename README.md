# Unified-Mentor-Internship-Project-4-Detect_Lung_cancer

## Objective
 Build a system that can predict the survival of a patient given details of the patient. Explore the
 data to understand the features and figure out an approach.

## Dataset
 This dataset contains data about lung cancer Mortality and is a comprehensive collection of patient
 information, specifically focused on individuals diagnosed with cancer.
 
## Description of columns:
 ● id: Aunique identifier for each patient in the dataset.<br>

 ● asthma: Indicates whether the patient has asthma (e.g., yes, no).<br>
 ● cirrhosis: Indicates whether the patient has cirrhosis of the liver (e.g., yes, no).<br>
